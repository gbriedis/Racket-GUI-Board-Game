# Comp-Sci-Second-Project

## Project
Design, code, and present a GUI game within a group of 1 to 5. During the development phase, a   prototype software will be used to allow a deeper understanding of the final product.   Racket will be the language used to create the game. Since the game will have GUI-the library will be imported `(require racket / gui / base)` - the base library will have the required class, configuration, and method bindings specified in this manual. `#lang racket / gui` â€” The language of racket / gui integrates all racket code bindings with racket / gui / base and racket / draw plugins.
## Create a GUI game which follows some rules:
* Must have GUI
* Must be a game / allow people to play
* Feedback showing the game state
* Allow players to perform moves
* Disallow illegal moves
* Wining state + notification

## Recommendation 
* With this type of challenge you will want to focus on user friendliness, ease of use (simplicity is key)
* Use a prototype tool (software) to create an idea before coding
